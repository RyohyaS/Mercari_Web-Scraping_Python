# Mercari_Web-Scraping_Python

This is a code using Selenium&Webdriver to perform a Webscraping on the website “Mercari”. →Please enter a new css selector as appropriate. Chrome Web Driver also tripped me up on the version, so be careful.

Functions that could be done with a little more work (no plans to make them at the moment) ▶️GUI ▶️Page number selection setting (currently handled by changing the last part of the url) ▶️Exclude keyword setting (currently handled by adding the url at the end of the url to exclude)
